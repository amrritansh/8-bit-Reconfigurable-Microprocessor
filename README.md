# 8-bit-Reconfigurable-Microprocessor
Designed an 8-bit reconfigurable microprocessor in Verilog. It features a 2Kx8 memory initialized from hex, control logic decoding opcodes, and an ALU performing add, subtract, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts. The top module synchronizes operations via clock/reset, fetches instructions with a program counter, and loads external data on demand.
